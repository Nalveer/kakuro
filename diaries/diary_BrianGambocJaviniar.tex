{\bf Where:} Hall building 920 \\
{\bf Activities:} I was not in the class first day, so according to everyone, a source of communication needed to be established and to get to know one another.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} To use Discord, Github, Trello, and everyone's contact information.\\

{\bf Where:} Hall building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:} We talked about the project in general. The roles and tasks that needs to be done in iteration 1, and I got to know them.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We established the user stories, and finally got respective roles to focus on. Decided on the design, where we would use java swing and the model-view-controller architecture.\\

{\bf Date:} 16 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:15 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:30 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} Hall building 920 \\
{\bf Activities:} We made sure everyone was okay with their respective roles as the organizer organized this small meeting, so that we can fill up his form for his five questions.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Clearer view that our roles are established, and to drop Trello and just use GitHub.\\

{\bf Date:} 16 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:30 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 9:20 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Hoang Thuan Pham, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} Hall building 523 \\
{\bf Activities:} Talk about our previous use cases and refactor them as we learn new things during the tutorial.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Finalized the use cases and shared our discovery with the team on Discord.\\

{\bf Date:} 22 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:15 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:30 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} Hall building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:} We had to discuss our findings and sort our misunderstanding with the use cases and future implementations on what will be done and what needs to be done.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} The documenters came into an understanding with the coders and assigned roles to keep the work flowing from the little work we had on google drive.\\

{\bf Date:} 26 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 12:00 AM\\
{\bf End Time:} 2:10 AM \\
{\bf Who:} Brian Gamboc-Javiniar\\
{\bf Where:} Home \\
{\bf Activities:} Working on my assigned tasks for the documents on context, actors, domain concepts, and looking into domain models.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Finished my part of the documents and created a folder in google drive called `docs to merge` so that everyone can put their parts inside. I also created a use case diagram for my use case, and learned about domain modelling, so that Hoang and I can have a call and create it together.\\

{\bf Date:} 26 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:00 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:00 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Hoang Thuan Pham\\
{\bf Where:} Home and voice call through discord \\
{\bf Activities:} Showcase our progress as we said it needed to be 60\% done by today and discuss apparent confusion on current diagrams.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We met our goal and cleared a bit of confusion since Hoang made a template to follow, which made it easier for everyone to get on the same page. But, we set a new deadline to have 90\% of the contents done by Tuesday.\\

{\bf Date:} 27 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 9:00 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 10:00 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Hoang Thuan Pham\\
{\bf Where:} Home and voice call through discord \\
{\bf Activities:} Create a domain model and discuss the structure and necessary objects.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We created a `draft` domain model to show others and get their input.\\

{\bf Date:} 29 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 12:00 AM\\
{\bf End Time:} 3:00 AM \\
{\bf Who:} Brian Gamboc-Javiniar\\
{\bf Where:} Home \\
{\bf Activities:} Get everything that we shared in google drive into overleaf (latex). Format the tables and figures one by one appropriately before the `demo` in the lab at H-831.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} I finished formatting the file and make it pretty for the demo. As we said, we wanted 90\% of the file done, which we achieved, therefore, we still needed to properly finish the document. I mentioned my findings after completing the document in overleaf to discord and converted our latex file to PDF for the demo.\\

{\bf Date:} 29 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:15 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:30 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} Hall building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:} Present a demo of our `prototype and documentation to the TA for feedback.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} As all demos are not always perfect, we had some feedback that was good and needed to change, which we told the person assigned to fix the docs associated to the comments and to tell others to complete their part by the final day.\\

{\bf Date:} 05 February 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:15 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:30 PM \\

{\bf Where:} Hall building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:} TA looking a bit on our documentation. We also conveyed our current status of the documentation, and most of the time deciding new roles for the next iteration.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Finalized our new rules for next iteration. We also decided to ask all documenters to push all their missing things in the shared latex file before Saturday, so that we can have a call and proofread our iteration 1 document.\\

{\bf Date:} 06 February 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:15 PM\\
{\bf End Time:} 9:15 PM \\
{\bf Who:} Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Hoang Thuan Pham\\
{\bf Where:} Hall building: 8th floor public area \\
{\bf Activities:} Reworked the domain model with our new knowledge from the feedbacks from our teammates and the TA.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Finalized the domain model.\\

{\bf Outcomes:} After hours of talking, and then communicating our results on fixing our assigned `potential problems`, we were able to finish and the iteration 1 document.\\
