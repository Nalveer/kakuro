Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-920 \\
{\bf Activities:} We introduced each other and learned our interests and motivation. We talked about what are expected from everyone which are honesty, respect and hardwork. Then, we determined and created platforms for communications. We took note of everyone's emails.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} For communnication, we have chosen Discord which I created a server later on and added everyone. For programming, it was GitHub where Vsevold Ivanov created a repository. Jia Ming created the Then, we fixed the next meeting at the lab Wednesday. Total time of this week: 3 hours.\\ \\

{\bf Where:} H831 \\
{\bf Activities:} The tutor, Mohammad Reza Rejali, covered the "programming cycle" - Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation and Maintenance. He introduced us to the difference of the lecture, tutorial and lab and their importance. He talked about the goal of a software, its problems, its solutions and its benefits. The tutor explained and went over the project description, about the demo and the diffent roles (Coder, Documenter, Organizer).\\

Then, team PK-A discussed about who will do what for Iteration. There will be 3  coders, 5 documenters, 1 QA and 1 organizer. \\

Coders: Isabelle Charette, Nalveer Moocheet and Vsevolod Ivanov\\

Documenters: Tiffany Ah King, Chang Liu, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Nolan Mckay and  Hoang Thuan Pham\\

Organizer: Jia Ming Wei\\

Quality Control: Audrey-Laure St-Louis\\

As a team, we discussed about the different user cases and we came up with five. Each coder and documenter have each one user case to take care of for Iteration 1. 
\\

{\bf Outcomes:} Everyone in the group got a role and we were aware of the test cases. We all had flexible tasks to explore before the next meeting. We started to think in terms of MVC for the structure of the code and of the documentation. We exchanged schedules through Discord\\\\

I skimmed over the "Monopoly Project Analysis and Development Plan Version 1.3" LaTex pdf that the professor, Greg Butler posted on his site. It was very resourceful and it helped me to have a headstart on the documentation. Futhermore, I documented myself on the Kakuro game and went on several websites like wikipedia among others.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} I wrote the title cover, the table of content, the introduction and try to make it have a good alignment.I had a problem with the date appearing at the top each time and I was able to resolve it. I used the LaTeX Base online to start with.\\ \\

{\bf Where:} H-831\\
{\bf Activities:} We updated our work on where we were at that moment. The documenters were supposed to learned LaTex and to review  the user cases. Everyone tried to clear some confusion and misunderstandings and shed light on the implementation details. We also discussed about the upcomming demo lab of the Proof of Concept (PoC) which will be held on Wednesday 29 January in H831 at 19h15.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Some misunderstanding were cleared. The documenters have decided to use google drive to share the work and the outline of what we are doing.The coders and documenters have their own discussion on their parts. The documentation group including me decided who will do what for the "Requirement Document" for Iteration1 . I am in charge of the title page, the introduction, the table of content, the references and the game mechanics because I already started it. We agreed to do a voice call over Discord on Sunday 26 January at 19h00. \\ \\

{\bf Activities:} As the only present team with the TA, we decided to start the second iteration. We discussed each roles and what each sub teams are supposed to do by defining a schedule to follow to ensure a good flow of Iteration 2. We used the whiteboard to design the class diagrams according to what were asked and we decided to create a database. We assigned coders to their parts with each one having an assigned QA teammate to ensure TDD and coverage. More questions were asked and any issues were resolved. \\
{\bf Outcomes:} Each team members have their roles and everyone agreed to the schedule. We decided to move the next meeting during the reading week at 19h00 until 21h00 on the 26 February in person.
