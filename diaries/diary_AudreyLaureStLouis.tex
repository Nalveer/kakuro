\section{Iteration 1}

{\bf Date:} January 9th 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 20:15\\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-920  \\
{\bf Activities:} After the lecture, we all got together and decided that our official first meeting would happen during the first lab on Wednesday (since two people were missing). We exchanged our personal information (email, phone number, etc.) and created a Discord server for our communications. \\
{\bf Outcomes:} We all agreed to use discord for communication purposes, Trello for project organization and Github for code management. We also decided to use Google Docs and Latex to share and edit documents. \\

{\bf Date:} January 15th 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 19:15\\
{\bf End Time:} 22:00\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-831\\
{\bf Activities:} We talked about the project and its requirements for the first iteration. We also attributed a role (coder, documenter, organizer or QA) for each member of the team.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We set a meeting for the coders.\\

{\bf Date:} January 17th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 10:30 \\
{\bf End Time:} 13:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Isabelle Charette, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nalveer Moocheet, Audrey-Laure St-Louis. \\
{\bf Where:} LB-353(Kenya) \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
We started brainstorming about MVC behind the use cases. We did some UML diagrams to represent our approach of the game and we shared them to the rest of the team via Google Docs. We also split the work in different parts and each programmer was attributed with a task.\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
We provided documents and sketches for the documenters to start working on and all coders had a pretty good idea of how we would proceed with the coding part. We also discussed a little bit about the unit tests.\\

{\bf Date:} January 22nd 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19:15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} H-831 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
During the lab, some stuff was clarified and some questions answered about use cases and project requirements. Also, everyone provided an update to the team of their part.\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
We planned a meeting on Sunday January 26th for the coders to resolve some issues and to start merging our codes.\\

{\bf Date:} January 29th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 17:00 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} Grey Nuns B-122 and H-831 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
The initial meeting (on Sunday) was moved to today. For the first two hours, all the coders and the QA met, we merged all codes, resolved some conflicts and tested/fixed the application before the demo. After that, everyone member of the team met at the lab at 19:15 and we did our presentation for the demo.\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
Feedback was given from the TA on both the documentation and the code.\\

{\bf Date:} February 5th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19:15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} H-831 \\
{\bf Activities:}We Showed the TA the unit tests we developed so far. We also started discussing the roles for the second iteration. Finally, we discussed about our code for refactoring and making it more clear.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We got a bit of feedback from the TA for our test codes.\\

%\section{Iteration 2}

{\bf Date:} February 5th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19:15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} LB-451 \\
{\bf Activities:} We discussed the roles for iteration 2 and we talked about the test cases that needed to be added to the code with the TA. \\
{\bf Outcomes:} We established some deadlines and some milestones for the coders and the documenters. \\

{\bf Date:} February 26th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19:15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} LB-451 \\
{\bf Activities:} - We decided not to randomize the generation of the puzzles. We will use a game that is in the database and we will fetch it every time the player ask for a new game. We decided not to store the solution of each puzzle in the database.
We all agreed on the following use cases : 1) Save game : Hardcoded user (Anonymous user). Will save the game in the database. When the player press. 2)resume, it will get the game back from the database. 3)Load game 4) Login (Iteration 3). 5) Restart game 6) Score (Iteration 3) 7)Difficulty levels (Maybe iteration 2). Also, for the database design, we opted to create 3 tables for the database (info stored in it not determined yet) and we decided to merged save cells and game cells together. Finally, We discussed the system and subsystems of our software Kakuro.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We got a bit of feedback from the TA for our test codes.\\

{\bf Date:} March 4th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 14:30 \\
{\bf End Time:} 19:00 \\
{\bf Who:} Isabelle Charette, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} 7th floor, Hall Building \\
{\bf Activities:} We discussed the documentation. We split the work and we all started to work on our personal section. We asked ourselves questions and we supported each other. We also decided who would present our work in front of the class.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We knew exactly what to work on. We got good feedback from the TA for our demo at 19:15 today.\\

{\bf Date:} March 11th 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19:15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21:00 \\

{\bf Where:} H-831 \\
{\bf Activities:} We discussed the documentation and the code. We exchanged information about the evolution of Iteration 2. The TA answered some of our questions. We talked about refactoring and the changes that have been made to improve the overall readability of the code. \\
{\bf Outcomes:} We established a deadline for the coders so the documenters can arrange their part.  \\
