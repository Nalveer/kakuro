Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-831\\
{\bf Agenda topics discussed:} \\
(1) Define the new Documentation to write\\
(2) Define the new features of Use Cases to develop\\
(3) Discuss the QAs test plan to ensure TDD and coverage\\
(4) Align the team towards the same goal\\
(5) Discuss any issues involving the entire team\\
{\bf Alternatives presented:} \\
(1) Code first continuation to avoid DB by the use of class Serializer of existing code \\
{\bf Solutions agreed upon:} \\
(1) Documenters and QAs did not raise any concern about DB, we went further with it\\
{\bf Assignments made and accepted:} \\
(1) Vsevolod will be the Organizer acting as a facilator and suggesting technologies \\
(2) Nolah will setup sqlite DB with their tables layout for load/save game use cases\\
(3) Brian will write the DB API connected to the MVC for load/save game use cases\\
(4) Tifany and Nalveer will oversee the sqlite QA entirely\\
(5) Hoang will write the restart/load/save game use case as well as adjust the UI for them\\
(6) Chang will perform the QA on Hoang parts\\
{\bf Deadlines:} \\
(1) MVC Diagram and Documentation V1 19 February 2020;\\
(2) Database delivery with API and Documentation V2 26 February 2020;\\
(3) Demo, Documentation V3, Tests and Integration March 4 2020; \\
(4) UI Integration 11 March 2020. \\
(5) Submission 15 March 2020 at 21:59. \\
{\bf Follow-up actions:} The timeline for iteration 2 is clear. Use cases and tasks are assigned to coders, QAs and two documenters on everything.\\

(3) The team should meet and resolve any misunderstandings for Iteration 2 about the domain model and use cases; hear how the Coders plan to implement their assigned use case; hear what issues the Documenters have, and what content/information they need. Everyone can help create sample data as needed by the unit tests.
(4) Review the timeline overall for iteration 2, assigned tasks and deadlines
(5) Plan the Demo next week
