\section{Iteration 1}

{\bf Date:} 09 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:15pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 9:15pm\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-920 Lab \\
{\bf Activities:} I wasn't there for the first meeting, so this is what I understood has happened in my absence: discussion of interests, what platform to use to best communicate, which tool for version control.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Choice of Trello, Discord and GitHub, exchange of people's contacts.\\

{\bf Date:} 15 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:00pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 9:00pm\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-831 Lab \\
{\bf Activities:} Discussion on team roles, the project needs, communication and use cases.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Set the team roles, wrote the uses cases in shared google doc.\\

{\bf Date:} 16 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 8:15pm \\
{\bf End Time:} 8:30pm\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-920 Lab \\
{\bf Activities:} Short meeting to agree on the roles everyone was assigned.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} Scheduled a meeting for just the coders next day.\\

{\bf Date:} 17 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 10:30am\\
{\bf End Time:} 1:00pm\\
{\bf Who:} Isabelle Charette, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nalveer Moocheet, Audrey-Laure St-Louis\\
{\bf Where:} Library building \\
{\bf Activities:} Discussed how to separate the coding tasks, discussed MVC structure, drawings of the classes, the domain models, uses cases diagram.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We agreed on the coding tasks according to use cases. Shared the diagrams on discord.\\

{\bf Date:} 22 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:15pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:45pm\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-831 Lab \\
{\bf Activities:} We discussed user stories and requirements. We cleared out questions about which use cases were to be implemented for iteration 1. \\
{\bf Outcomes:} We set a deadline for the completion of the code in order to able to merge the week after.\\

{\bf Date:} 29 January 2020\\
{\bf Start Time:} 4:00pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 7:00pm \\
{\bf Who:} Isabelle Charette, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nalveer Moocheet, Audrey-Laure St-Louis\\
{\bf Where:} Grey Nuns \\
{\bf Activities:} We merged each of our branches together, resolved the conflicts and made sure it was ready for the lab demo. The UI was up and running but not fully connected to the rest of the implementation, however we had a fully working Kakuro in the console.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} We made a branch with the most up to date working version of Kakuro and made note of how to better merge our work next time. We also discussed the MVC pattern to make sure our code best followed the structure and realized we needed to adjust the View.\\

{\bf Date:} 29 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:15pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:45pm\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis\\
{\bf Where:} H-831 Lab \\
{\bf Activities:} lab demo in front of the class (presentation by Vsevolod and Nolan), presentation of GUI and console Kakuro, presentation of documentation in relation to code and test cases. \\
{\bf Outcomes:} We got feedback from the TA and noted what needed to be added to the documentation and JUnit tests to be added to the code. \\

{\bf Date:} 5 February 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 7:15pm\\
{\bf End Time:} 8:45pm\\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei\\
{\bf Where:} H-831 Lab \\
{\bf Activities:}  We discussed the roles for iteration 2 and the test cases that needed to added to the code with the TA.\\
{\bf Outcomes:} I made a spreadsheet to make sure the roles for iteration 2 were coherent with the roles of iteration 1. Everyone is finishing up for the submission of iteration 1, diaries are added to GitHub, JUnit test cases are also added to the master branch.\\
